Welcome to Sumo2Unity Tool

## Introduction
Sumo2Unity seamlessly integrates SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) with Unity, a powerful 3D game engine. This open-source project bridges the gap between microscopic traffic simulation and real-time 3D visualization, empowering you to Immerse yourself in a simulated traffic network. This will help to gain deeper insights through real-time observation and interaction. This can be used to leverage the combined power of both platforms for research, development, and educational applications in transportation.
